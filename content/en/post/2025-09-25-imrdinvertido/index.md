summary:  "IMRaD is the publication standard, but it need not dictate the writing process. This post argues for a 'reverse' writing strategy—from findings back to the introduction—as a method to enhance honesty and clarity, distinguishing it from HARKing and aligning narrative with genuine scientific discovery."

# Introduction


{{% callout note  %}} "What if we wrote backwards? Not from Introduction to findings, but from findings back to the Introduction."
{{% /callout %}}


**IMRaD—Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion—** functions as an editorial public good: it standardizes manuscripts, facilitates peer review, and enables cross-article comparisons.  
Moreover, starting with the scientific problem matters: formulating it well is equivalent to having already solved half of it (1).  

This post does not propose abandoning **IMRaD**, but rather distinguishing between two complementary orders:

- **Publication order (IMRaD):** useful for evaluation and information retrieval  
- **Writing order (guided by findings):** useful for aligning the narrative with what we actually learned and separating confirmatory from exploratory analyses (2,3).


**In practice:** first draft the key **Results** (estimates, confidence intervals, relevance), then the **Discussion** (plausibility, biases, sensitivity), followed by fully transparent **Methods** (clearly stating what was pre-specified, what changed, and why), and finally a concise, precise **Introduction** that frames the actual research question or hypothesis truly aligned with the results.  
The final manuscript still adheres to the **IMRaD** format.

# When to Use It—and When Not To

**Recommended for:** observational studies, secondary analyses, unexpected discoveries, and applied data science where iteration is inevitable.

**Use caution / Not recommended for:** Registered Reports, confirmatory trials with pre-specified statistical analysis plans (SAPs) (CONSORT), and systematic reviews with pre-registered protocols (PRISMA).  
In these cases, maintain the primacy of the original plan and explicitly label any exploratory components as such (4,5).


# Critical Objections (and Evidence-Based Responses)


**“This encourages HARKing.”**

**Response:** quite the opposite—if explicit labeling and open materials are required.  
*HARKing involves concealment; here we demand clear differentiation between confirmatory and exploratory analyses and full documentation of any changes (6–8).*

**“The Introduction loses its purpose.”**

**Response:** it actually becomes stronger.  
*It frames the real problem illuminated by the evidence, without forcing a fictitious chronological narrative. The ICMJE promotes IMRaD for clarity—not for rewriting history (9).*

**“Editors require strict IMRaD compliance.”**

**Response:** we preserve it.  
*Only the writing workflow changes, not the macrostructure. Moreover, TOP Guidelines and open practices enhance editorial trust (10).*

**“Unexpected results are overvalued.”**

**Response:** demand sensitivity analyses, negative controls, replication, and avoid fetishizing p < 0.05.


# Transparency Checklist

| Element | Confirmatory | Exploratory |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Pre-specification | Linked protocol/SAP | Not pre-specified (with justification) |
| Results | Labeled as pre-specified | Labeled as post hoc |
| Analyses | Conducted per plan | Limited, with sensitivity analyses |
| Open resources | Data/code/notebook shared | Code and decision criteria documented |



## Conclusion

IMRaD structures and enables comparability across scientific articles.  
Integrating a findings-driven writing approach offers a moderate, practical way to gain honesty, utility, and traceability—without sacrificing methodological rigor or editorial clarity.  
In certain contexts—especially exploratory ones—it can be the difference between a narrative faithful to discovery and a fictitious chronology.
