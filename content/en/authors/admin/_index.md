  summary: |
    I acquired fundamental knowledge in data mining, covering the identification of patterns and trends in large volumes of information. I became familiar with key technological trends driving deep learning, including supervised classification techniques (decision trees, K-NN) and clustering (K-Means, DBScan). I developed skills in building, training, and applying Bayesian network models, using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate their performance. Finally, I applied these techniques in personal projects, using R and Python for advanced analyses.

  summary: |
    I gained basic knowledge in pattern recognition, covering the classification of patterns using distance and similarity functions, as well as non-parametric classification techniques. I became familiar with feature selection and extraction, the design of linear discriminant functions, and basic probability concepts applied to the field. I developed skills in unsupervised learning and clustering, exploring algorithms such as K-means, LBG, and Isodata. Finally, I understood the fundamentals of syntactic pattern recognition, including the theory of formal languages and recognition grammars.

  summary: |
    I acquired fundamental knowledge in Python programming, covering the basic syntax of the language, operators, control structures, and other essential resources. I became familiar with data structures such as strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, and learned how to manipulate them efficiently. I developed skills in modular code organization using functions, classes, modules, and packages, as well as implementing programs under the object-oriented paradigm. Finally, I gained experience in handling errors and exceptions in Python, enabling me to develop more robust and reliable applications.

## About Me

Hello, I’m Maicel Eugenio Monzón Pérez. I’m a physician, biostatistician, and data scientist, passionate about transforming health research through science, statistics, and artificial intelligence.
I graduated as a General Practitioner in 2003 and later pursued a Master’s in Health Informatics, the Biostatistics specialty (first and second degree), and finally a PhD in Medical Sciences at the University of Medical Sciences of Havana.
Throughout my career, I have worked on the design and analysis of biomedical research, with a particular focus on clinical trials and the application of machine learning models to solve real-world problems in health.
I also enjoy programming in R and Python, creating tools that enhance research efficiency and improve clinical decision-making. Today, I share my experience as an Assistant Professor at the National School of Public Health and as a Clinical Trial Reviewer at the Center for State Control of Medicines, Equipment, and Medical Devices.
My purpose is clear: to strengthen a more robust, innovative, and evidence-based health system, bringing together medicine, statistics, and technology to generate real impact in people’s lives.
