# Professional Collaborations

As a professional with expertise in biostatistics, machine learning, and clinical trials, I offer personalized support for projects that promote ethical scientific advancement. These collaborations are strictly independent and do not represent or involve any institutions where I participate in contracted roles. To avoid any conflict of interest, all interactions are guided by principles of transparency, confidentiality, and separation of professional responsibilities. If you are part of a regulated environment, I recommend reviewing internal policies before exploring options.

## Areas of Support
Focused on educational and technical contributions, I can collaborate on:

- Statistical analysis for clinical or experimental data, with an emphasis on robust methodologies.
- Consulting on research methodology for theses or postgraduate studies in biomedical sciences.
- Ethical review of research protocols, prioritizing general regulatory compliance.
- Complex data processing, including predictive modeling in R or Python.
- Personalized training sessions on topics such as model validation in healthcare.

This support is tailored to researchers, students, or independent teams, always with a focus on scientific integrity.

## Collaboration Process
1. Free Exploratory Chat: Schedule an initial 30-minute session via [Zoho Bookings](https://bioestadisticaedu.zohobookings.com/#/4778182000000049054) to discuss ideas without obligation.
2. Ethical Evaluation: We confirm there are no conflicts and outline a plan aligned with professional standards.
3. Flexible Development: We proceed only if both parties are comfortable, with clear, remote deliverables.

This ensures a responsible and collaborative approach.
