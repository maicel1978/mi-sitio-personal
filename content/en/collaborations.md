👨‍⚕️📊 I am a physician, biostatistician, and data scientist, with training and experience in the design and analysis of complex health studies. My work focuses on three interrelated areas: epidemiological research 🌍, clinical research —especially clinical trials and regulatory compliance— 💊, and health informatics, where I apply statistical modeling 📐 and artificial intelligence to biomedical data 🤖.

This combination of disciplines allows me to contribute rigorously and ethically to the development of projects that require methodological soundness, reproducibility, and alignment with international scientific standards.

## Independence and Transparency:

It is fundamental for me to state that all my collaborations are strictly independent and personal. These services do not represent or involve any of the institutions where I perform my contractual roles. I maintain a strict separation of professional responsibilities.

To avoid any conflict of interest, all interactions are guided by principles of professional ethics. For details on confidentiality, data handling, and conflict policy, please consult our **[Privacy and Professional Confidentiality Policy](/privacy/)**.

If you operate in a regulated environment, I strongly urge you to review your organization's internal policies before initiating any collaboration.

## Areas of Support

My consultancies are designed for professionals, researchers, and industry partners who require the utmost methodological rigor and advanced technological solutions.

### 1. Methodological Strategy and Clinical Biostatistics 🔬

Design, ethics, and methodological rigor aligned with global standards (ICH/GCP). Ideal for biopharma, CROs, and academic teams looking to minimize errors in the critical planning phase.

- **Statistical Design of Clinical Trials**: Complete strategies —from Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) to sample size calculation and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)— ready for audit.
- **Regulatory and Bioethical Review**: Critical analysis of protocols to comply with regulators and ethics committees, preventing unnecessary delays and rejections.
- **Advanced Epidemiological Methodology**: Design and analysis of cohort, case-control studies, with a focus on causal inference and population health assessment.
- **Thesis and Publication Consulting**: Support from the formulation of the research question to the writing of manuscripts ready for high-impact journals.

### 2. Health Statistics and its Relationship to ML/AI Models 🧠
I transform complex biomedical data into robust models, clear visualizations, and workflows that save time and increase confidence in results.

- **Predictive Modeling with ML/AI**: Interpretable algorithms for diagnosis, prognosis, or risk stratification —with rigorous internal and external validation.
- **Big Data Analysis in Health**: Handling of structured and unstructured data (clinical records, genomics, surveys) using advanced techniques: survival analysis, multivariate models, clustering, etc.
- **Reproducibility and Automation**: R/Python pipelines that link code, analysis, and final reports, eliminating manual errors and speeding up results delivery.

### 3. Critical Science and Clear Communication 🌐
Because good science deserves to be seen, understood, and used. This pillar integrates mentoring, dissemination, and digital presence with an academic purpose.

- **Personalized Scientific Mentoring**: 1:1 sessions on topics such as causal inference, Bayesian biostatistics, R/Python programming, or study design —adapted to your goals.
- **Modern Academic Websites**: Elegant, fast, and functional platforms (using Hugo, Quarto, etc.) for your profile, lab, course, or open science project.

## Collaboration Process
1. Free Exploratory Chat: Schedule an initial 30-minute session via [Zoho Bookings](https://bioestadisticaedu.zohobookings.com/#/4778182000000049054) to discuss ideas.
2. **Scope Definition**: We confirm no conflicts of interest and outline a plan aligned with professional standards.
3. Flexible Development: We proceed only if both parties are comfortable, with clear and remote deliverables.

This ensures a responsible and collaborative approach.
