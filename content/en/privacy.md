# Privacy and Professional Confidentiality Policy

Ethical rigor and trust are fundamental pillars of all consulting services. This policy establishes the terms under which your information is handled and the separation of professional responsibilities.

## 1. Commitment to Strict Confidentiality

I commit to handling all information shared during collaborations (protocols, raw data, results, ideas, correspondence) with the utmost discretion.

* **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):** I am willing to sign specific Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) if your project requires it or if it involves sensitive data.
* **Information Reservation:** All technical or strategic client information will be treated as the exclusive property of the client.
* **Data Management:** Once the collaboration and the delivery of the agreed results are complete, the raw and working data files will be deleted from my storage systems to protect your intellectual property.

## 2. Conflict of Interest and Role Separation Policy

Consulting independence is critical. My services are offered in a personal capacity and not as a representative of any other entity.

* **Total Separation:** My professional consulting services are **strictly independent and personal**.
* **No Institutional Representation:** Under no circumstances do my services represent or involve the institutions where I perform other roles. **Transparency** and the **clear separation of professional responsibilities** are the guiding principles to avoid any actual or perceived conflict of interest.
* **Recommendation to the Client:** If you operate in a regulated environment (pharmaceutical, CRO, public sector), you are strongly advised to review your organization's internal policies on external consulting before initiating a collaboration.

## 3. Handling of Personal Data and Website Information

This section applies to the use of personal information collected through the website and scheduling tools.

* **Data Collected:** Only the personal information necessary to schedule a meeting (name, email, project description) is collected through third-party tools (e.g., Zoho Bookings).
* **Data Usage:** Data is used **exclusively** to manage the collaboration, respond to inquiries, or send updates if you subscribe to the newsletter.
* **Third-Party Tools:** The scheduling and subscription platforms operate under their own privacy policies, which must be consulted by the user. **I do not share your personal information with third parties for commercial or marketing purposes.**
